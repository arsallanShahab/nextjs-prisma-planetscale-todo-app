# 🚀 Next.js Todo App with Prisma 🚀

Welcome to our super cool Todo application! It's not just any Todo app, it's one that's been built with some of the most powerful and cutting-edge technologies out there. We're talking Next.js, Prisma, TypeScript, and more! Plus, we've added a sprinkle of Framer Motion for animations, Lucide React for those sleek icons, and Day.js for handling dates like a pro.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 🛠️

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Our trusty React framework for building JavaScript applications.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): The open-source database toolkit that we can't live without.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Because who doesn't love static typing?
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/): For when our app needs to strut its stuff.
- [Lucide React](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide): For icons that are easy on the eyes.
- [Day.js](https://day.js.org/): Because handling dates shouldn't give you a headache.
- [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/): For notifications that are literally 🔥.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): For when we want our app to look its best.

## 📁 Project Structure 📁

- `src/`: Where the magic happens (aka our source code).
- `prisma/`: Home to our Prisma configuration and schema files.
- `public/`: A place for our static files to chill.
- `components.json`: The blueprint for our UI components.
- `package.json`: The who's who of our project dependencies.

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

Ready to take this project for a spin? Here's how:

1. Clone the repository (welcome aboard 🎉).
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install` (our project's nutrition).
3. Copy the `.env.sample` file to a new file named `.env` and fill in the environment variables (shhh, it's a secret 🤫).
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev` (and we're off 🚀).

Just a heads up, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
